## 1. The Role of Randomness

### Uncertainty

A business is an activity we control with an expectation of a profit.

The payoff is often uncertain; if we do consultancy work, it's easier to predict the boundaries.

Success is when payoff meets expectations; in other words, our bet meets the expectations.

What's necessary for a business to become successful? Many things, but these often are not sufficient, because we're dealing with human behavior, which is random / unpredictable.

If there is a variable which is off, the business will fail. But we don't know why! The fact is that nobody understands this world in reality.

How can we detect unpredictability (after Taleb, The Black Swan)?

- The predictable world: success is almost guaranteed if you do the correct things and put the effort. Example: learn medicine and become a doctor. 
- The stochastic world: success is randomly determined. Examples: writing a book, starting a company, etc.

### The Predictable World

The most familiar one: we study, start a job, follow the career leader, etc.

Degree of success is within a narrow range.

We have a predictable path and payoff.

It's not necessarily easy, but it's predictable and accessible.

Freelancing consultants belong to this world, because they are coupled to the physical time they invest.

### The Stochastic World

It is unfamiliar to us. 

Daniel tells the first thing he did when he quit his job was in line with the predictable world: as a SW engineer, he thought he needed to create a SW product, polish it, work hard.

However, there are wild differences in degrees of success. It is extremely competitive and unpredictable. The vast majority will fail, but there is a large upside for the winners.

Success tends to bring more success: [The Matthew Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect)

How can be learn to operate in this world? We should look at organizations or individuals that operate in it:

- Venture capitals
- Book publishers
- Movie studios
- etc.

### Stochastic Operators

How do they tame uncertainty? They bet:

- They look for authors with ideas
- They generate opportunities
- They manage parallel bets: they build a portfolio

A book on the topic: [Hollywood Economics](https://www.amazon.es/Hollywood-Economics-Uncertainty-Routledge-Contemporary/dp/0415312604). The thesis is that it's not possible to predict whether a movie will be a success. And the root of the unpredictability is human behavior. However, movie studios are very profitable: they are not on a single movie, but they build a portfolio, which is!

VCs do something similar; they know that

- Start-ups which seem like they are going to be successful can end up as a failure.
- Businesses that seem that they are not going to make it become a success.

They know they're going to have failures; the goal is to succeed at the portfolio level. Example from Statista: Penguin revenue.

They idea is to **generate randomness and opportunities and define a filter of what opportunities take or avoid.**

[Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com) is an example.

Daniel thinks that ideas don't come out of the blue in the shower. They rather appear in the random interaction with the world.

### The Individual's Portfolio

- Must avoid tying all time and energy to one thing.
- Must resist believing that something will certainly work.
- Must resist the idea that you've found your best idea.
- Must treat ideas little cattle, not pets.

A full-time job comes with implicit expectations and you can't/don't have time for side hustles. In contrast, a freelancing job gives more flexibility; it's understood that you have other clients.

Daniel talks about the MVP validation approach; he thinks that it's incompatible with the stochastic world. The issue is that when we validate an idea, we think we've found the product-market fit, so we go all in, i.e., we don't have a portfolio anymore!

As an example he gives the first product he launched: Userbase. It seemed to be a success at launch day, even Paul Graham liked it -- i.e., a complete validation. But then, it didn't work. The reason is another company with similar features that seemed to work better. The worst part is he invested a lot of personal money on it.

His lesson is: we should have several projects going on, a portfolio! This also gives you more peace of mind.

Great blogpost by [Sahil Lavingia](https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting), founder of Gumroad, on the topic.

Daniel thinks AWS is actually a portfolio of around 200 products. Not all of them are successful. Amazon works like an umbrella company which has many products.

The take: we should have a portfolio of clients and jobs going on in parallel. That is a dent in the income in the short run, but an upside in the long run.

Some tricks:

- Try to have low expectations.
- Start projects as if they were small.
- Avoid big bets: don't work long on the project to ship! Long is 3 months? **Daniel tries to bring something to market in a week. A month is too much!**
- Avoid tying to identities related to businesses or projects; we're more than that and should have the freedom to choose what to be.

### The Individual's Generator

- Must have abundant spare time.
- Must be flexible to pounce on opportunities.
- Must have continuous sources of inspiration.
- Must have various capabilities.

Daniel's idea generator is Twitter, consuming his feed. He sees people doing their own thing and he comes up with ideas for his own domain. He acknowledges that most of the days nothing comes up, but there are days on which a strong signal emerges.

We should try to find something similar: something we do every day that can bring us ideas.

### The Individual's Filter

- Asymmetric bets are not enough.
- Can't take 1 in 1000 odds if you can only try 5 times.
- Go for the smallest things.
- Trade upside for higher odds of success.
- Then, success will bring with it other success.

Asymmetric bets are the ones in which we invest few, compared to what we can get.

### Mapping the Predictable World to the Stochastic World

Very important slide:

### Questions

Examples of income sources:

- SaaS. Expected to have exponential increase.
- Freelancing. Constant income.
- Info products (courses, etc.). Peaks that decay.

Daniel explains how the Small Bets community evolved as something successful even though it had not the current from in the beginning. He did one cohort and it worked, so he organized 4 more and started to invite guest talkers and paid them.

We should avoid things that have high running costs: energy, frustration, time, etc. We should rather have things that we do either happily or generate almost a passive income.

Daniel has become good at ignoring opportunities that would take longer than 1 month to bring to market. He tries to create things that can be published in one week.

## 2. Bias for Survival

### Survivorship Bias

Daniel shows two examples of how people miss-understand the random or stochastic world:

- John O'Nolan (Ghost): he said that the key secret was to appear at the office every day even when things were going wrong. That is more an advice for a predictable world, but not for a stochastic world!
- ConvertKit Founder: he said that one should focus on one thing. But he admitted to having tried many businesses before. Thus, it turns out having a portfolio is fundamental.

The problem is not the advice: the problem is that focusing and persevering is valid for the predictable world!

Similar biased advice:

- Focus on one problem.
- Just build something useful.
- Just follow your passion.
- Just make your product 1% better every day.
- Just obsess on your customers.
- Just execute the best idea.
- Just keep showing up.

### Spotting Survivorship Bias

- Ignore the role of randomness.
- Cherry picking success from the stochastic world.
- Believing that what worked, will always work.
- Believing that what didn't work, will not work. There's a quote over there: "Only fools try the same thing expecting different results"; that quote is not that valid for the stochastic world.
- Ignoring the Pareto distribution of success. Success is usually distributed following power laws. Daniel shows the creator earnings distribution: less than 1% make the vast majority of the earnings.

Daniel has several products and explains how randomness has affected in their success or failure. The takeaway is that when something fails, we shouldn't waste much time thinking on why this has happened. Examples:

- AWS book: random endorsement by Sahil, the founder of Gumroad.
- Twitter course: great success, but no endorsement.

Daniel thinks now more self-published books are sold, for instance at Gumroad. It's important to sense what's going on and what's going to happen. However, we should not trust so much ourselves, instead have a small bets portfolio!

Important paper by Taleb: **Understanding is a Poor Substitute for Convexity (Antifragility)**. At the end, he says we don't need to understand why things work/don't work, but instead have a small bets strategy.

Interesting: Daniel estimates company market size by looking at twitter account followers.

### Acquiring Knowledge

- Predictable world
  - Look at what works for others.
  - It will almost certainly work for you too.
- Stochastic world
  - Hard to separate signal from noise.
  - Requires probabilistic knowledge.
  - No understanding necessary.

Probabilistic knowledge: if we want to increase the odds of survival of a plant from another environment, we should try to replicate the environment. Similarly, if we want to succeed with a project, we should try to copy the format of similar projects that succeeded. It could be that it fails, but it's better to try things that worked.

### Why Does This Matter?

Daniel explains several decisions he took, which might not be the best, but he really doesn't know:

- Gumroad landing page for all his products, nothing more, not even a webpage.
- Everything on Gumroad.
- ...

Takeaway: The world is complex. 

### Our Case Against Survivorship Bias

- We recognize the role of chance.
- We don't ignore randomness, but embrace it.
- Our portfolio strategy is tried and tested for the stochastic world.
- We encourage predictable activities in the portfolio.
- In the stochastic world, we acquire knowledge probabilistically.

### A Bias for Survival: The Preppers

When Daniel moved to Seattle 10 years ago, he understood the reasonable approach that the preppers take.

He thinks that the prepper mindset is very powerful:

- Negative visualization.
- Seek peace of mind.
- Scope of robustness.
- Down-side first attitude.

The idea is that we predict what could go very wrong and then plan how to recover from it, or prepare for it - even before it happens. For example: we think we might loose our job, or we have a family and we think we might die.

This way, we prepare and then focus on the upside.

### Avoiding Failure

- Be a prepper. Prepare for the bad to have peace of mind.
- Beware of the fallback. Daniel tells how he could go back to his 9-5 job when he quit; however, that's risky: he started thinking big with Userbase, risking too much. It's better to think we don't have a fallback: that way our mindset is like: "this needs to work"; thus, we try more bets, smaller.
- A sense of urgency. Stop playing around and start making money immediately. Daniel tells how he clicked away from the fallback illusion when he realized he didn't want to go back to his job.
- We are wired to earn every day.
- Stay with the low-hanging fruit. Don't start with big things, but with easy smaller things.

Daniel tries to continue with his lifestyle; he manages to not go back to the 9-5 worklife.

Having a small win is very useful, because it gives us information and changes our mindset: we have a funnel (views, buys, sales). 

Daniel mentions usually he sees something that works and then he has the idea he could do something similar that works.

### Small Wins

Image of the Survivorship Bias story from the WW2: shot airplanes, etc.

- Not much to learn from failures.
- Potential for negative knowledge.
- Small wins bring much ore information.
- Small wins add capabilities.
- Success brings with it other success.
- A string of failures is demotivating.

## 3. Generating Luck

### Luck Recognition

Luck is favorable randomness. To benefit from luck, we must:

- attract luck
- recognize luck

### Preparation

What knowledge and skills do I possess?

Take stock of your assets:

- Skills
- Interests, hobbies
- Knowledge
- Experience
- Credentials
- Connections
- Capital
- Reputation
- Location (place can be an advantage)

Scott Adams talks about talent stock; he says he's a mediocre cartoonist, a mediocre programmer, etc. But the combination of the talents make him uniquely advantageous and he's got a very nice market-product fit.

We should do something similar: we should analyze our assets and see which is the unique combination we offer; then, we try to go that unique way.

Also, when we start analyzing the combinations, we see which skills are missing: we spot knowledge that would give us the needed advantage for that project we have in mind. Daniel gives as an example that he realized he lacked marketing knowledge and reputation.

So:

- Take stock of our assets.
- Assemble assets stacks.
- Find what's missing.
- Acquire missing assets with small bets.
- Repeat the process periodically. Ideally daily.

Daniel tells how he started answering questions he knew the answer to in Stackoverflow, etc. The first year he tried many different things, like long-form blogging, etc. Now, he basically narrowed down to Twitter.

### Inspiration Generator

An inspiration generator is:

- A catalyst for preparation.
- An opportunity for serendipity.
- Find a cocktail party equivalent. For Daniel, that's Twitter. Other people think it's awful and addictive, but he finds many ideas there.
- Makes randomness your friend.

Daniel tells how he decided to write the short AWS because he saw a tweet of a similar book.

He also shows how some Gumroad courses are just first-view iPhone recorded videos with high information density, often niche topics, and without high-tech gear. That catalyzed his creativity: he thought he could start doing the same! That's when he decided to do his Twitter course: he did it in 16h and ended up being more successful than the AWS book.

Lesson: things are very random and sometimes the information quality & density is more important than the formatting.

Sometimes people sell books that are composed of available blog posts, and the books sell! There is an advantage to having everything in a place, a people seem to value it.

Daniel admits he's a perfectionist, OCD type. He's been working on it in the last years in order to have time-boxed small bets.

Question: are there any assets we should acquire before any small bets? Daniel thinks that **reputation** and **marketing** are essential; without them we cannot get attention and trust towards our product. However, you don't necessarily need a Twitter audience to ship products; we can use other ways like SEO, etc.

Daniel is selective with possible small bets; he chooses things that have a low maintenance effort.

Some sources:

- Twitter: Peter Askew, levelsio, etc.
- Podcasts: Indie Hackers, Writers on the Side
- Look for expiring domain names on GoDaddy.com

### Opportunity

Seneca: Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.

- An opportunity is someone wanting something you can do.
- How do you find these people?
- And how do you make them choose you?
- And how do you get many of these opportunities?
- It boils down to **credibility and attention**.

### Attention and Credibility

There are many ways to get attention, you don't need a media followership.

Attention sources:

- SEO: appear one of the first; it's tough.
- Ads: pay Google to rank high.
- Platforms: Youtube, Amazon, Udemy, etc.
- Website referrals.
- Followers.
- Attending conferences.
- Personal network.
- Public forums: reddit, etc.
- Private communities: Discord.
- Freebies: give something away for free.
- Word of mouth.

Credibility sources:

- Testimonials.
- Reputation.
- Success stories.
- Skin in the game: the pilot is trusted because he's on the plane, too.
- Credentials.
- A good domain name. Good domains matter because when we look for items in Google, we automatically choose the ones that seem more trustworthy -- and in the case of domains, the most credible domain makes it.
- Selection by a publisher.
- Selection by an investor.
- Selection by an employer.
- Selection by well-known customers.
- Marketing. Sometimes marketing is a credibility game: seeing a brand on a billboard makes it more credible.

### Learn from Others

- Study the people you listen to.
- Study the people you buy from.
- How did they get your attention? Why do we interact with them?
- Why do you trust them?
- Examine your own behavior.

### Luck Blindness

- Not knowing your assets.
- Not having enough assets stacks.
- Asset stacks not commercially viable.
- No inspiration generator.
- No assets that generate attention.
- No assets that help build credibility.
- Narrow goals.
- Too selective; we should have a sense of ethics, but we shouldn't throw away opportunities. Thus, marketing, social media publicizing, etc., maybe deserve a try.
- Busy schedule. Have some slack in the system, be a little bit unemployed to avoid a busy schedule.
- Lack of freedom.

Daniel says he's very ruthless when it comes to time-boxing.
