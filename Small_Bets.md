## 1. The Role of Randomness

### Uncertainty

A business is an activity we control with an expectation of a profit.

The payoff is often uncertain; if we do consultancy work, it's easier to predict the boundaries.

Success is when payoff meets expectations; in other words, our bet meets the expectations.

What's necessary for a business to become successful? Many things, but these often are not sufficient, because we're dealing with human behavior, which is random / unpredictable.

If there is a variable which is off, the business will fail. But we don't know why! The fact is that nobody understands this world in reality.

How can we detect unpredictability (after Taleb, The Black Swan)?

- The predictable world: success is almost guaranteed if you do the correct things and put the effort. Example: learn medicine and become a doctor. 
- The stochastic world: success is randomly determined. Examples: writing a book, starting a company, etc.

### The Predictable World

The most familiar one: we study, start a job, follow the career leader, etc.

Degree of success is within a narrow range.

We have a predictable path and payoff.

It's not necessarily easy, but it's predictable and accessible.

Freelancing consultants belong to this world, because they are coupled to the physical time they invest.

### The Stochastic World

It is unfamiliar to us. 

Daniel tells the first thing he did when he quit his job was in line with the predictable world: as a SW engineer, he thought he needed to create a SW product, polish it, work hard.

However, there are wild differences in degrees of success. It is extremely competitive and unpredictable. The vast majority will fail, but there is a large upside for the winners.

Success tends to bring more success: [The Matthew Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect)

How can be learn to operate in this world? We should look at organizations or individuals that operate in it:

- Venture capitals
- Book publishers
- Movie studios
- etc.

### Stochastic Operators

How do they tame uncertainty? They bet:

- They look for authors with ideas
- They generate opportunities
- They manage parallel bets: they build a portfolio

A book on the topic: [Hollywood Economics](https://www.amazon.es/Hollywood-Economics-Uncertainty-Routledge-Contemporary/dp/0415312604). The thesis is that it's not possible to predict whether a movie will be a success. And the root of the unpredictability is human behavior. However, movie studios are very profitable: they are not on a single movie, but they build a portfolio, which is!

VCs do something similar; they know that

- Start-ups which seem like they are going to be successful can end up as a failure.
- Businesses that seem that they are not going to make it become a success.

They know they're going to have failures; the goal is to succeed at the portfolio level. Example from Statista: Penguin revenue.

They idea is to **generate randomness and opportunities and define a filter of what opportunities take or avoid.**

[Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com) is an example.

Daniel thinks that ideas don't come out of the blue in the shower. They rather appear in the random interaction with the world.

### The Individual's Portfolio

- Must avoid tying all time and energy to one thing.
- Must resist believing that something will certainly work.
- Must resist the idea that you've found your best idea.
- Must treat ideas little cattle, not pets.

A full-time job comes with implicit expectations and you can't/don't have time for side hustles. In contrast, a freelancing job gives more flexibility; it's understood that you have other clients.

Daniel talks about the MVP validation approach; he thinks that it's incompatible with the stochastic world. The issue is that when we validate an idea, we think we've found the product-market fit, so we go all in, i.e., we don't have a portfolio anymore!

As an example he gives the first product he launched: Userbase. It seemed to be a success at launch day, even Paul Graham liked it -- i.e., a complete validation. But then, it didn't work. The reason is another company with similar features that seemed to work better. The worst part is he invested a lot of personal money on it.

His lesson is: we should have several projects going on, a portfolio! This also gives you more peace of mind.

Great blogpost by [Sahil Lavingia](https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting), founder of Gumroad, on the topic.

Daniel thinks AWS is actually a portfolio of around 200 products. Not all of them are successful. Amazon works like an umbrella company which has many products.

The take: we should have a portfolio of clients and jobs going on in parallel. That is a dent in the income in the short run, but an upside in the long run.

Some tricks:

- Try to have low expectations.
- Start projects as if they were small.
- Avoid big bets: don't work long on the project to ship! Long is 3 months? **Daniel tries to bring something to market in a week. A month is too much!**
- Avoid tying to identities related to businesses or projects; we're more than that and should have the freedom to choose what to be.

### The Individual's Generator

- Must have abundant spare time.
- Must be flexible to pounce on opportunities.
- Must have continuous sources of inspiration.
- Must have various capabilities.

Daniel's idea generator is Twitter, consuming his feed. He sees people doing their own thing and he comes up with ideas for his own domain. He acknowledges that most of the days nothing comes up, but there are days on which a strong signal emerges.

We should try to find something similar: something we do every day that can bring us ideas.

### The Individual's Filter

- Asymmetric bets are not enough.
- Can't take 1 in 1000 odds if you can only try 5 times.
- Go for the smallest things.
- Trade upside for higher odds of success.
- Then, success will bring with it other success.

Asymmetric bets are the ones in which we invest few, compared to what we can get.

### Mapping the Predictable World to the Stochastic World

Very important slide:

### Questions

Examples of income sources:

- SaaS. Expected to have exponential increase.
- Freelancing. Constant income.
- Info products (courses, etc.). Peaks that decay.

Daniel explains how the Small Bets community evolved as something successful even though it had not the current from in the beginning. He did one cohort and it worked, so he organized 4 more and started to invite guest talkers and paid them.

We should avoid things that have high running costs: energy, frustration, time, etc. We should rather have things that we do either happily or generate almost a passive income.

Daniel has become good at ignoring opportunities that would take longer than 1 month to bring to market. He tries to create things that can be published in one week.

## 2. Bias for Survival

### Survivorship Bias

Daniel shows two examples of how people miss-understand the random or stochastic world:

- John O'Nolan (Ghost): he said that the key secret was to appear at the office every day even when things were going wrong. That is more an advice for a predictable world, but not for a stochastic world!
- ConvertKit Founder: he said that one should focus on one thing. But he admitted to having tried many businesses before. Thus, it turns out having a portfolio is fundamental.

The problem is not the advice: the problem is that focusing and persevering is valid for the predictable world!

Similar biased advice:

- Focus on one problem.
- Just build something useful.
- Just follow your passion.
- Just make your product 1% better every day.
- Just obsess on your customers.
- Just execute the best idea.
- Just keep showing up.

### Spotting Survivorship Bias

- Ignore the role of randomness.
- Cherry picking success from the stochastic world.
- Believing that what worked, will always work.
- Believing that what didn't work, will not work. There's a quote over there: "Only fools try the same thing expecting different results"; that quote is not that valid for the stochastic world.
- Ignoring the Pareto distribution of success. Success is usually distributed following power laws. Daniel shows the creator earnings distribution: less than 1% make the vast majority of the earnings.

Daniel has several products and explains how randomness has affected in their success or failure. The takeaway is that when something fails, we shouldn't waste much time thinking on why this has happened. Examples:

- AWS book: random endorsement by Sahil, the founder of Gumroad.
- Twitter course: great success, but no endorsement.

Daniel thinks now more self-published books are sold, for instance at Gumroad. It's important to sense what's going on and what's going to happen. However, we should not trust so much ourselves, instead have a small bets portfolio!

Important paper by Taleb: **Understanding is a Poor Substitute for Convexity (Antifragility)**. At the end, he says we don't need to understand why things work/don't work, but instead have a small bets strategy.

Interesting: Daniel estimates company market size by looking at twitter account followers.

### Acquiring Knowledge

- Predictable world
  - Look at what works for others.
  - It will almost certainly work for you too.
- Stochastic world
  - Hard to separate signal from noise.
  - Requires probabilistic knowledge.
  - No understanding necessary.

Probabilistic knowledge: if we want to increase the odds of survival of a plant from another environment, we should try to replicate the environment. Similarly, if we want to succeed with a project, we should try to copy the format of similar projects that succeeded. It could be that it fails, but it's better to try things that worked.

### Why Does This Matter?

Daniel explains several decisions he took, which might not be the best, but he really doesn't know:

- Gumroad landing page for all his products, nothing more, not even a webpage.
- Everything on Gumroad.
- ...

Takeaway: The world is complex. 

### Our Case Against Survivorship Bias

- We recognize the role of chance.
- We don't ignore randomness, but embrace it.
- Our portfolio strategy is tried and tested for the stochastic world.
- We encourage predictable activities in the portfolio.
- In the stochastic world, we acquire knowledge probabilistically.

### A Bias for Survival: The Preppers

When Daniel moved to Seattle 10 years ago, he understood the reasonable approach that the preppers take.

He thinks that the prepper mindset is very powerful:

- Negative visualization.
- Seek peace of mind.
- Scope of robustness.
- Down-side first attitude.

The idea is that we predict what could go very wrong and then plan how to recover from it, or prepare for it - even before it happens. For example: we think we might loose our job, or we have a family and we think we might die.

This way, we prepare and then focus on the upside.

### Avoiding Failure

- Be a prepper. Prepare for the bad to have peace of mind.
- Beware of the fallback. Daniel tells how he could go back to his 9-5 job when he quit; however, that's risky: he started thinking big with Userbase, risking too much. It's better to think we don't have a fallback: that way our mindset is like: "this needs to work"; thus, we try more bets, smaller.
- A sense of urgency. Stop playing around and start making money immediately. Daniel tells how he clicked away from the fallback illusion when he realized he didn't want to go back to his job.
- We are wired to earn every day.
- Stay with the low-hanging fruit. Don't start with big things, but with easy smaller things.

Daniel tries to continue with his lifestyle; he manages to not go back to the 9-5 worklife.

Having a small win is very useful, because it gives us information and changes our mindset: we have a funnel (views, buys, sales). 

Daniel mentions usually he sees something that works and then he has the idea he could do something similar that works.

### Small Wins

Image of the Survivorship Bias story from the WW2: shot airplanes, etc.

- Not much to learn from failures.
- Potential for negative knowledge.
- Small wins bring much ore information.
- Small wins add capabilities.
- Success brings with it other success.
- A string of failures is demotivating.
